# Specify - Specification-Driven Development Extension

A VS Code extension for managing specifications and implementing specification-driven development workflows.

## Features

### üìã Spec Management
- **Create Spec**: Easily create new specification files with a comprehensive template
- **Activity Bar Views**: Organized views for Requirements, Implementations, and Spec Navigation
- **Auto-parsing**: Automatically parses and updates spec content when files are saved

### üöÄ AI Integration
- **Implement Spec**: One-click integration with GitHub Copilot to implement specifications
- **Smart Parsing**: Intelligent parsing of markdown specifications into actionable items

### üìÅ Project Structure
The extension expects specifications to be organized in a `specs/` directory with numbered subdirectories:
```
workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 002-feature-name/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md
```
